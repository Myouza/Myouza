I am a **Computational Humanist** — applying formal methods (optimal transport, evolutionary algorithms, systems architecture) to problems in media studies, game preservation, and literary analysis. My research treats technical systems as objects of critical interpretation: code as text, constants as cultural artifacts, archives as discourse.

### 🎭 **About the Avatar**

**Fun Fact:** The avatar is a hand-drawn icon based on my MMORPG character — a young-boy archetype Shaolin monk named 鸣裟 (Myouza). In reality, I'm a long-haired adult who was already 21 when I started this 7-year journey.

> **Fun Fact¹:** I composed a character verse:
> 
> 鸟`鸣`袈`裟`外，帝啼襁褓中。
> 
> *"The `my`na's s`o`ng s`o`ars past the [kā`ṣā`ya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasaya_(clothing)); / The king keens, caught in cradle cloth."*
> 
> > **Fun Fact¹·¹:** Techniques: [对仗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithetical_couplet) + [拆字](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/拆字) (鸣 contains 鸟; 啼 contains 帝). Alludes to [ATU 707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Golden_Children_(folklore)) / [狸猫换太子](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_Prince_Replaced_by_a_Cat).
> > 
> > **Fun Fact¹·²:** Translation by Claude Opus 4.5. Prompt: *"Translate with David Hawkes' phonetic name-embedding, Lucas Klein's foreignization, and Jennifer Feeley's sibilant-plosive alliterative compensation."*
> > 
> > **Fun Fact¹·³:** "Myouza" is not the standard Sino-Japanese reading — I deliberately adopted [Buddhist on'yomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%27yomi#Go-on) (cf. 輪廻→*rinne*, 袈裟→*kesa*).
> 
> **Fun Fact²:** The monkey is the Shaolin faction mascot in the game, worn as an [ita-bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ita-bag).
